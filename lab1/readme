## An indication of how much time you spent doing the assignment. 

I spent a day configuring the Linux environment suitable for my programming
I spent about three days to finish this project.
The first day I finish the basic client and server which can connect with each other.
The second day I finish multithreading in the server and almost know how to transfer a big file between this two program.
And use python to write a test file that can automatically test.
It is powerful.
The last day I spent the whole day finishing the feather that can transfer a big file.
First I use a linked list to save data and transfer them one by one.
But according to the text file, the output is wrong from line 136.
I tried to transfer the whole node but can't. 
It is unrelated to TCP.
TCP never lost the message.
When night fell, I realized that I couldn't send all the data without stop.
So I send the message to the client after the server output the data to ensure receive have time to output.
At that time, I succeeded.

##  Did it help you to learn? What did it help you to learn? Do you have any suggestions form improvement?

Yes, It helps me to learn.
I totally understand TCP never lost the message.
And TCP just sends my message as a stream.
I have understood the application layer protocol.
I have the concept of how the HTTP works.
Maybe in the future, we can try to finish an HTTP protocol?
It is fascinating.

## Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. 

1. I totally finish all the feater of these projects.
2. The whole struct of my program is easy to add function in the future.
3. I use fgets() function if in the future I need to finish an HTTP protocol, it is useful.
4. I don't like getopt(), so I design a function named a check_options() in server.
5. Using getaddrinfo() to find the address if hostname isn't a IP address.
